1st video embedded:
What is imbedded systems?
- It’s a system that is specifically designed to get certain results 
- Most of technologies today are designed using imbedded systems 
- the difference between a microcontroller and a microprocessor :
- A microcontroller contains a microprocessor inside it 
- microcontroller: is a mini processor connected to peripherals and modules to use it in different applications 
- We can say that a microcontroller is full motherboard with better features for controlling purposes 
- ARM: stands for Advanced RISC Machines 
- Why ARM? 
- 32 bit 
- High performance 
- Bigger memories (Flash-SRAM)
- Supporting real time operating system RTOS

2nd video imbedded:
Microcontrollers structures 
- why do we use microcontrollers?
- Low priced component compared to others
- Small size
- Easy to contact with the outer world er other devices 
- Can be programed for the purpose you want 
- Composed of:
- CPU
- Temporary Memory sRAM
- Permanent Memories (Flash, EEPROM)
- Buses
- Peripherals

1st Git& GitHub 
- Git is a distributed version control system 
- It’s free and open source : no cost needed and you can contribute to it yourself 
- GitHub is source for projects and resources
- GitHub can be replaced with GitLab and BitBucket but GitHub is more efficient 
- GitHub simplifies using Git
- Git can be used without GitHub
- Git has GUI 
- Using Git solved a lot of coding problems and made it easier for a group to work on the same project at the time ,find errors and fix them 

2nd Git& GitHub
- Repository is a storehouse for data
- A Repository consists of branches 
- Local Repository is the your work on the PC
- Remote Repository can be the main server or GitHub you’re working on 
- Commit is like a checkpoint on your local Repository 
- Cloning can be from local or remote repository 
- Push : uploading local changes to remote
- Pull : pulling changes from remote to local repository 

3rd Git& GitHub 
- How to sign up to GitHub ?
- Signing up process is as simple as any other social media site 
- How to new repository for your team ?
